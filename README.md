Delhi Air Quality Analysis 🌫️
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes Delhi’s air quality using publicly available air pollution data. The project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into pollution levels across different time periods.

📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is a major concern in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world. This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to understand trends in Delhi’s air quality.
Key tasks performed:
•	Data loading and preprocessing
•	Handling missing values
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualization of pollutants across time (seasonal, yearly, hourly trends)
•	Basic statistical insights

 Dataset
The notebook expects Delhi air quality dataset (CSV or similar).
If you don’t have the dataset, you can download from:
•	Kaggle – Delhi Air Quality Dataset

Results
•	Time-series plots of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, Ozone
•	Seasonal and yearly trends in Delhi’s air quality
•	Comparative analysis across different monitoring stations

🔮 Future Work
•	Build predictive models (ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest) for forecasting air quality
•	Deploy as a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
•	Perform correlation analysis with weather data
